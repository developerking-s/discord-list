## Self Hosting

We use Astro to build the website. To run the website locally, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/). Alternatively, feel free to use [Bun](https://bun.sh) to run the website locally. Our current project is configured to build for Netlify, if you want to build for Vercel, you can change the configuration in the `astro.config.js` file. The same goes for other platforms.

### Running the website locally

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rovelstars/discord-list
   ```

2. Change the directory to the project directory

   ```bash
   cd discord-list
   ```

   At this point, you should fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

3. Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install # or bun install if you are using Bun
   ```

4. Run the website

   ```bash
   npm run dev # or bun dev if you are using Bun
   ```
